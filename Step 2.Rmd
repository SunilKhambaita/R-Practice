# Q2 Creating Sequences

### 2.1.  Creating sequences
We just learned about the `c()` operator, which forms a vector from its arguments.  If we're trying to build a vector containing a sequence of numbers, there are several useful functions at our disposal.  These are the colon operator `:` and the sequence function `seq()`.

##### `:` Colon operator: 
```{r}
1:10 # Numbers 1 to 10
127:132 # Numbers 127 to 132
```

##### `seq` function: `seq(from, to, by)`
```{r}
seq(1,10,1) # Numbers 1 to 10
seq(1,10,2) # Odd numbers from 1 to 10
seq(2,10,2) # Even numbers from 2 to 10
```

###You don't need to edit anything in below. 

\textcolor{red}{> To learn more about a function, type `?functionname` into your console.  E.g., `?seq` pulls up a Help file with the R documentation for the `seq` function.}

#### (a) Use `:` to output the sequence of numbers from 3 to 12
```{r}
3:12
```

#### (b) Use `seq()` to output the sequence of numbers from 3 to 30 in increments of 3
```{r}
seq(3, 30, 3)
```

#### (c) Save the sequence from (a) as a variable `x`, and the sequence from (b) as a variable `y`.  Output their product `x*y`
```{r}
x <- 3:12
y <- seq(3, 30, 3)
x * y
```
